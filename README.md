# birthday
Your challenge is to build a web app that will ask the user for a name and birthday.

When the user submits the form, and depending on the current date, the app will either:

wish the user happy birthday
tell them how long they'll have to wait until their next birthday

First, don't panic.
2. get something that displays 'Happy Birthday' on the screen
 - OK, I got this to work but couldn't work out how to test it

3. Change this to be a form
4. Save the contents of the form
5. See where we are...
